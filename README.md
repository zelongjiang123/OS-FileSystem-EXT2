## Project overview:

Each disk will be given to you in the form of a disk image (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_imageLinks to an external site. ). A disk image is simply a file containing the complete contents and file system structures.

Identify an inode that represents a jpg file and copy the content of that file to an output file (stored in your 'output/' directory), using the inode number as the file name. For example, if inode number 18 is a jpg file, create a file 'output/file-18.jpg' which will contain the exact data reachable from inode 18.
